# COVID-19-BY-COUNTY

## The map of COVID-19 in United States by County

http://datamapproject.com/

The initial view of the map shows a **heatmap of COVID-19 conditions in the United States by county**. Clicking on the county will zoom the map to the clicked county. Information about the county will show in the information box.

When zoomed to a certain level, **hospitals** are shown as grey circles. Clicking on the circles will show a tooltip of information for the clicked hospital. The proportion shown as â€˜XX beds per confirmed' assumes that all beds are for COVID-19. The actual number of beds available will be much lower. 

*(Repatriation/Cruise ship cases, unknown cases, unassigned cases, and out-of-state cases are excluded from the map)*
